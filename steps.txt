# I cannot import numpy (solved)
I tried to install it like this
 https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/help/installing-uninstalling-and-upgrading-packages.html#d110070e130
but then I got an error to get something from visual c++ compiler for python which I installed from here
 http://aka.ms/vcpython27
I installed it then again got the numpy from the setting, project interpreter.

TaCo (for **Ta**ble **Co**mparison) is an interactive comparison tool that effectively visualizes the differences between multiple tables at various levels of granularity.

To use TaCo make sure that you have the [TaCo client plugin](Caleydo/taco) installed.

The server part comes with a Python table generator and modifier.

For now it reads a csv file and modify it randomly using the following operations
* Add random rows
* Add random columns
* Delete random rows
* Delete random columns
* Modify random cells
